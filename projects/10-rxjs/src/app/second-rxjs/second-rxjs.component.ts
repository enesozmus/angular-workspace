/** ðŸ”´ RxJS Operators
 * Operators are functions.
 * RxJS is mostly useful for its operators, even though the Observable is the foundation.
 * Operators are the essential pieces that allow complex asynchronous code to be easily composed in a declarative manner.
 * 
 * There are two kinds of operators:
    1-) Creation Operators
    2-) Pipeable Operators
      - A Pipeable Operator is a function that takes an Observable as its input and returns another Observable.
      - It is a pure operation: the previous Observable stays unmodified.
 */

/** ðŸ”´ pipe()
 * pipe() can be called on one or more functions, each of which can take one argument ("UnaryFunction") and uses it to return a value.
 * It returns a function that takes one argument, passes it to the first UnaryFunction, and then passes the result to the next one, passes that result to the next one, and so on.
 * The pipe() function is an assembly line with operators on an observable data source.
 * obs$.pipe(op1(), op2(), op3(), op4());
